Early detection of Parkinson's Disease using Machine Learning Techniques
Book 1 consists of using dataset how we train our model with different algorithms of machine learning .. geting the accuracy score and checking which one is much more 
suitable for us.

Book 2 consists of coming down to detecting parkinsons using machine learning technique which is SVM
